### Currently working with python.
I have made a few projects you can look at below. None complex, but I used several different modules to accomplish my goals
Just continueing to explore python and build things to learn.

I have a directory in [pythonLearning](https://github.com/Wblake95/pythonLearning) called Games where I test things and play with math a little.
