# Hi, i’m Wesley (Wes or Blake) Blake
## Professional work: Human Resources.

### Currently working with python.
#### [My repository](https://github.com/Wblake95/pythonLearning)
1. Working on a calculator in GTK.
   * Made in GTK3 will transition to GTK4.
2. Learning Selenium for work use.
   * Might not post here, very specific information.
4. Next python project to learn is Django - back end.
   * I have some articles to start with.
   * Will use the built in data base for simplicity, then implement one later.
5. Data science. I bought a No Starch Press book (Dive Into Data Science)
