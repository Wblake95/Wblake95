# Hi, iâ€™m Wesley Blake
## Current Profession: Human Resources
## Desired Profession: Data Analytics / Back End Development
### Tools
1. [Python](https://github.com/Wblake95/Python) for data science and statistics.
2. [BASH](https://github.com/Wblake95/Bash) and [Linux](https://github.com/Wblake95/Config-Files) for simple automation and simplicity with my job.
### Things I Just thought Were Cool
[C](https://github.com/Wblake95/C), I want to spend more time on it. 

[Lua](https://github.com/Wblake95/Lua), Interesting language, simple to learn but I would imagine it to be difficult to master.

[Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)](https://github.com/Wblake95/Excel-VBA), great way to practice programming concepts in the real world if you don't have access to a real language at work.

[Blog](https://wblake95.github.io/), I was curious how Github Pages worked. I might continue to work on this in the future.
